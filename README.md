Note : This is a portfolio-type repository made to showcase my own design patterns for an Ionic Angular project implementing state management with the Ngrx library (Redux pattern) along with

Gyomu is meant to be a simple project managing tool aimed at small teams. It goal is to remain as generic as possible so it could be used by any team from any background.
